Changes for Plack::Middleware::AutoRefresh

0.08 - Tue Mar 30 18:46:50 2010
	Bug fix release: close tcp sessions upon subsequent requests (RT#56119)

	Fixed a bug in which tcp sessions were remaining open. The js
	client would reload every 1.5s and eventually we would use up
	all the tcp ports.

	Made the js a bit more robust. Should deal with terminated
	plack servers much more reliably--ie, continue to try to reload.

	Initial release to cpan
